# Nora: The Banking Chatbot

## Introduction
The Chatbot “Nora” is developed as a mini project on Artificial Intelligence (COMP 472). In
order to solve the banking problem people face in their day to day life, the chatbot is created so
that people deal with their banking problems easily. It is a web based application intended to run
on the desktop environment which lets the user interact with the computer as a form of chat. It
will be using a model that gets trained with the user's banking data using Natural Language
Processing

## Background and Problem Statement
Banking has become a part of everyone’s life. Almost everyone uses the banking sector to
perform their tasks. Now the use of mobile and internet banking facilities has reached greater
heights. Chatbots are becoming trending today. They are computer programs that interact with
users using natural languages. For any banking related queries we have to go to the bank or call
customer care or search Google, which takes a lot of time and effort. On the other hand we don’t
get complete information from the customer care executives. It will be more suitable if we can
directly post our queries online or chat with the bank people and get the response within less
time.

The objective of this project is to contribute to the solution of the problem of direct and indirect
communication between users and Banking Institutions.To ensure easier banking process
through use of user interface. To minimize the time consumption between the customer and the
product and to provide 24*7 accesses to the bank and Banking Applications.
